<h1> Zoo </h1>

<h2> Summary </h2>

The Zoo project is a wide spread project built to allow us to sharpen our minds when mapping out our idea for organization
in regards to class inheritance.  We also got to practice communicating and linking classes to one another, how to engage with 
inherited properties or methods. 

<h2> Mapping </h2>

<h2> OOP Principles </h2>

Abstract: is a feature, when working within a class, that stats that any concrete thing that derives from this
 class must have this method or property and you must define it per the situation. In regards to the class itself 
abstract means you dont have enough information with this class to be a thing, you must be more specific.
-All my classes were abstract until the last 6 because in all the cases they are to generic, needed to specify more.
